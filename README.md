# vimsettings

Welcome to my .vimrc file

installations:

plugin manager --> 
    https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug
if you want a global linter --> 
    https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier --> install globally


If you want to set up your vim in a similar way to mine, Insert this file into 
```
~/.vimrc
```

my leader key is the space bar... If you see <leader>[key] - press space and then that key

You will then need to 
```
:w
```
then 
```
:source%
```
then
```
:PlugInstall
```

Good luck! :)
